 Welcome to Slax

 The boot menu offers several options, toggle them by [Space] key.
 If you need to edit boot command line (for advanced users), hit [Tab].
 When finished, navigate to "Run Slax" menu row and press [Enter].


 Persistent changes

 Save all Slax filesystem modifications to /slax/boot/changes/ and restore
 those changes next time you boot. Only usable while running Slax from a
 writable media such as USB device or hard disk.


 Copy to RAM

 Copies all data (entire /slax/ directory) to memory during Slax startup
 so you can eject the boot device. Make sure to uncheck persistent changes
 (see above) else your boot device will be still in use.


 Act as PXE server

 As soon as Slax is started, it runs DHCP and TFTP services at background
 to allow other computers on your network to boot Slax from net over PXE.
 This may be useful in classrooms.
