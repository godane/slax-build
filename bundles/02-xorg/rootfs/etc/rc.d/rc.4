# Reused Slackware's rc script, added watcher

# If X server fails to start, detect that and try few more things to make sure X works.
# This is started as a background process which watches Xorg.log file for 20 seconds
# and then exits (assuming if there was no X error in 20 seconds, it runs just fine).
# It is active only with xmode boot paramter, so don't use it if you don't like this.
